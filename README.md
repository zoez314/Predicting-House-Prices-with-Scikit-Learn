# 🏠 Predicting House Prices with Scikit-Learn

An end-to-end **machine learning regression project** using the California Housing dataset.  
This project walks through the full pipeline: data loading, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Scikit-Learn** — ML pipeline & models  
- **Pandas / NumPy** — data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** — visualization  

---

## 📊 Key Results
- **Linear Regression**: provides a simple baseline but struggles with complex patterns (higher RMSE).  
- **Random Forest**: performs significantly better, with lower RMSE and higher R², capturing non-linear relationships.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R² score  
- **Visualization**: scatter plots comparing predicted vs. true house values
